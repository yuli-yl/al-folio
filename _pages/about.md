I received my Master degree with 'Cum Laude' in 2017 from **[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/)** (KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium), under the supervision of **[Prof.Erik Jan Marinissen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikjanmarinissen/?originalSubdomain=be)** and **[Prof.Hailong Jiao](http://www.pku-vlsi.com/sample-page/hailong_jiao/)**.
